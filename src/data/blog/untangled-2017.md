This time last year, Neontribe developers ran [Untangled](https://www.neontribe.co.uk/untangled-2016/) - a week-long creative codecamp for young people who were interested. The theme that year was "Internet of junk"; Internet-enabled gadgets out of charity shop finds. My favourite was the toaster that knew how toasty you wanted your toast and turned the little browning knob round so you got it Your Way.

It's running again this year, and this year is games. We're giving them a very basic game, running on a Pi, and during the week they'll be adding features and fun to it.

The repo is [right here on Github](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/) - and an early comment on a PR accept?

> "this is fine hack but works"

I think they'll do OK.

And thanks to [our Ant](https://github.com/Stansbridge) for leading the charge from our side.

##Want to (web) develop your career with us?

We're a software development company working on web user interfaces and the APIs that power them. We've got a national reputation for our work in tech-for-good, an international reputation in travel and tourism, and right now we have more and more work coming our way.

We're expanding our teams in Norwich & Exeter. Right now, we’re recruiting to fill a couple of specific roles. However, we’re also always on the look out for people who would make our teams stronger, so if those roles don’t suit you please see the information at the end.

The two specific roles that will start out on a long-running project for an International corporate client are:

##Working mainly in HTML/CSS

You'll have a flair for implementing user interfaces using web technologies. Your tools will be HTML, CSS, and some Javascript and you’ll be passionate about HTML/CSS as a medium. You’ll already have plenty of experience of delivering in complex team projects and a commitment to delivering accessibility. You'll fully understand that what you are designing are interactions, on screens that vary in size, not fixed images on a fixed canvas. You'll have opinions on how to manage CSS in a team and you'll enjoy discussing different approaches to building and maintaining design systems.

##Working in JAVASCRIPT

You’ll be experienced at delivering javascript and confident in working with a complex project team. You’ll need to be comfortable working on the server, or in the toolchain, as well as in the client. We’d expect you to either have strong existing skills in Node.js, GraphQL, npm packaging or React or experience under your belt that shows how you transfer understanding between tools and frameworks so you can pick those up quickly from a wider javascript base.

##Alongside your core technical skills if you join us you’ll also need to:

- Be comfortable communicating in a remote team;
- Enjoy taking part in conversations in technical subjects;
- Be able to demonstrate that you enjoy expanding your knowledge and thinking critically
  (this can be via a degree, but 1/3rd of our team members don’t have one, so doesn’t have to be);
- Value agility in software development (experience is an advantage but not essential)
- Be passionate about accessibility
- Be keen to work in an organisation that delivers both commercial and social good projects
- Be inspired by user-centred development (even if you don’t have practical experience of this approach)
- Be committed to taking part in team activities and individual learning

##What these roles are not:

Neither of these are beginner roles.
You’ll need to have worked in coding teams on established projects and have well-developed skills in the appropriate languages for each role. You’ll also need to be able to show how your work experience to date equips you both for communicating with a remote team and getting your head down to get on with the task.

##What these roles are:

Great opportunities for growth and enjoyment.
Neontribe prides itself on skills development, great training budgets, flexible working, part-time hours and supporting return to work and other initiatives to help you enjoy your work.
Available at different career stages
We want to appoint one person who in addition to meeting the technical descriptions of their role, has experience of team leading and a passion for mentoring others and is ready to take on those responsibilities and another who is focused on delivering their own work but doesn’t yet want wider responsibility.  
Available in either Norwich or Exeter
We can also discuss possible mixed office and work from home patterns

##Salary

The salary available for the role involving mentoring will be in the region of £32-37k whereas the salary for the role focused predominantly on using your own skills will be in the region of £26-31k. Depending on applicants, either role could have either HTML/CSS or Javascript skill set

##To Apply

Send us your CV, or a list of skills and relevant experience, and a short email to indicate which role, and which level you think you would be interested, and we’ll arrange to set up a chat. We will interview anyone with the right skill set when we hear from them, so advise getting applications in as soon as possible. <future@neontribe.co.uk>

##Want to work with us, but don’t fit this role?

We’re always happy to hear from people who like the sound of Neontribe, and want to grow their skills as a developer, or in user research or product management. Maybe you’re already experienced - but have different specialist languages or maybe you're just getting started. If you have an eagerness to learn more and want to be part of a great company contact us with a short description of the skills you have and the skills you want to gain and we’ll let you know if we think there’s a place for us to start talking.

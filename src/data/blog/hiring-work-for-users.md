##Want to help our projects work for users?

We're a digital agency working in user research, software development and design. We're agile by instinct, and user-centred in our practice. We work together to identify and deliver on user needs. We've got a national reputation for our work in tech-for-good, and we have more and more work coming our way.

Right now, we’re recruiting to fill a specific role in our team. However, we’re also always on the look out for people who would make our teams stronger, so if this role doesn’t suit you please see the information at the end.

##Working in user research and service design

We’re looking to add someone to our small team that works with clients to help understand their problems. We want to find someone who’ll be excited sharing their ideas and making decisions about the best way to plan a research phase. And we’d like you to be confident enough to help newer people develop their skills and facilitate discussions with the client. You’ll often be involved throughout a project; from initial discovery work, through to usability testing products in a variety of stages of completion. 

##Alongside your core skills if you join us you’ll also need to:
- Be comfortable communicating in a remote context across a whole project team;
- Enjoy taking part in conversations about how best to understand genuine users needs;
- Be able to demonstrate that you enjoy expanding your knowledge and thinking critically (this can be via a degree, but 1/3rd of our team members don’t have one, so doesn’t have to be);
- Value agility in software development (experience of research in an agile environment is an advantage but not essential)
- Be an advocate for accessibility throughout our work
- Be keen to work in an organisation that delivers both commercial and social good projects
- Be committed to taking part in team activities and learning on your own

##What this role is not:

This is not a beginner role. You’ll need to have worked in user research and usability testing on established projects and have enough confidence to plan and facilitate  sessions comfortably. You’ll also need to be able to show how your work experience to date equips you both for communicating with a remote team and getting your head down to get on with a task of your own.

##What this role is:

A great opportunity for growth and enjoyment. Neontribe prides itself on skills development, flexible working, part-time hours and supporting return to work and other initiatives to help you enjoy your work. You’ll get 34 days holiday (including bank holidays and a company break midwinter, and £1,000 a year to spend on training. If you like working in an office, we're based in Norwich and Exeter. If you prefer to be remote except when visiting clients (post pandemic) we’re used to supporting that too. 

##Salary

We’d expect to pay in the region of £33k-£38k for this role (pro-rata). We’re interested in full or part-time applications.

##To Apply

Send us your CV, or a list of skills and relevant experience, and we’ll arrange to set up a chat. We will interview anyone with the right skill set when we hear from them, so we advise getting your application in as soon as possible: future@neontribe.co.uk

##Want to work with us, but don’t fit this role?

We’re always happy to hear from people who like the sound of Neontribe, and want to grow their skills as a developer, or in user research or product management. Maybe you’re already experienced in one field, but you want a change of focus, or maybe you're just getting started. If you have an eagerness to learn more and want to be part of a great company contact us with a short description of the skills you have and the skills you want to gain and we’ll let you know if we think there’s a place for us to start talking.

Ed found an affinity with the progressive culture of the tech community and now feels very at home working with the diverse and eclectic members of the Neontribe team.</p>  \n<h3>Key Skills</h3>  \n\n<ul>  \n<li>Learning</li>  \n<li>Improvising</li>  \n<li>Talking in front of people</li>  \n<li>Communicating</li>  \n<li>Teaching</li>  \n</ul>  \n\n<h3>Interests</h3>  \n<p>Music, creative coding, stories, people, having ideas & making things.</p>  \n</section>\n\n<section>  \n<h2>Nick Wade  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2019/01/nick.jpg\"/></h2>  \n<p>Programming and Design </p>  \n<p>After experimenting with online coding courses, Nick committed to becoming a developer by undertaking a Computing & Game Development degree as a mature student at Plymouth University.

She talked about how they do it: open conversations, surveys and card sorting.\n\nWe've fairly recently changed our term for this bit of the software development process. It was always &#x201c;Sprint 0&#x201d; for us, that chunk of work that needed to be done so you could start coding. Then we read the Service Design Manual, and appropriated the term &#x201c;Discovery&#x201d; for the same kind of activity. We been developing a set of tools for this piece of work for a few years now. As you'd expect from a company on the <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/09/digital-services-framework/\">Digital Services Framework</a>, we concentrate on users.\n\nThat said &mdash; we generally begin with a quick conversation about objectives. The objectives of a project will usually have been articulated before we've become involved, and all we're doing is making sure we understand. It's just a check.\n\n## Getting into a user-centred mindset\n\nThe meat of our work in Discovery is in user research. We'll be thinking about the demographics of the people who'll use the project, how they think and feel and behave. We might even have some analytics information from an existing version of the service\n\nIt continues with a workshop with our customer's staff. Where possible, we'll have people who might actually use the digital service along too to give us some real lived experience. Here we'll often generate personas: fictitious characters that we use to help make sure everyone's focussing on real user needs throughout the project. We'll generate these characters together. We'll give them a name, an age, we'll understand where they live, what their homelife is like, what some of the other important people in this life are like. We need to know enough about them for them to be useful, but they can evolve during the project. These first character sketches can be pretty quick and still useful. \n\nWhat these persona do is advocate on behalf of the people who'll eventually use the digital service. They represent the audience: unless the service is very targeted, they aren't all of it. They aren't average: they're individuals who we can ask questions. They won't lie to us: they won't be affected by other persona in the room as you might find real people at a focus group might be. They can reveal more about themselves than real people might: we can ask them questions about their unrealised needs in a way that isn't possible with real people. \n\nWhere this technique can fall down is where someone with an set view of precisely what the service should do. We've seen people like that use persona as a proxy for their pre-existing opinions. Having people who might use the service along to validate helps combat that. What we might also do is use a survey to check we're on the right track: that can expose entrenched thinking as unrepresentative.\n\nThat done, we'll put those personas in situations where their goals intersect with the project objectives. Those situations are generally one line or so - they certainly fit on a post-it note. They enable us to understand what's important to people who will actually use the digital service we're working on. \n\nThose personas, in those situations, help structure a conversation about what's important to the real people who'll use a digital service. The insights from those conversations, we validate with more user research as we move through development.\n\n",

It's just a check.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gettingintoausercentredmindset\">Getting into a user-centred mindset</h2>\n\n<p>The meat of our work in Discovery is in user research. We'll be thinking about the demographics of the people who'll use the project, how they think and feel and behave. We might even have some analytics information from an existing version of the service</p>\n\n<p>It continues with a workshop with our customer's staff. Where possible, we'll have people who might actually use the digital service along too to give us some real lived experience. Here we'll often generate personas: fictitious characters that we use to help make sure everyone's focussing on real user needs throughout the project. We'll generate these characters together. We'll give them a name, an age, we'll understand where they live, what their homelife is like, what some of the other important people in this life are like. We need to know enough about them for them to be useful, but they can evolve during the project. These first character sketches can be pretty quick and still useful. </p>\n\n<p>What these persona do is advocate on behalf of the people who'll eventually use the digital service. They represent the audience: unless the service is very targeted, they aren't all of it. They aren't average: they're individuals who we can ask questions. They won't lie to us: they won't be affected by other persona in the room as you might find real people at a focus group might be. They can reveal more about themselves than real people might: we can ask them questions about their unrealised needs in a way that isn't possible with real people. </p>\n\n<p>Where this technique can fall down is where someone with an set view of precisely what the service should do. We've seen people like that use persona as a proxy for their pre-existing opinions. Having people who might use the service along to validate helps combat that. What we might also do is use a survey to check we're on the right track: that can expose entrenched thinking as unrepresentative.</p>\n\n<p>That done, we'll put those personas in situations where their goals intersect with the project objectives. Those situations are generally one line or so - they certainly fit on a post-it note. They enable us to understand what's important to people who will actually use the digital service we're working on. </p>\n\n<p>Those personas, in those situations, help structure a conversation about what's important to the real people who'll use a digital service. The insights from those conversations, we validate with more user research as we move through development.</p>",

The problem that seAp needed to solve was that they had a limited number of volunteers who couldn’t support the growing number people needing their advocacy services. With funding from Comic Relief and the Legal Education Foundation we built two virtual advocating tools: one to help support people through the process of applying for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), and the other to help people prepare for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The tools were co-created with the people who would use them, to embed user needs at the heart of the build.

Great, you think, that will look ace at all the sizes I need to show it. This is mostly true, but there are a few catches that will require you to do a little extra work. Firstly IE8 and older just won’t so you will need to provide an alternative for these browsers such as:\n\n```\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>\n    <h1><img class=\"logo\" src=\"images/logo.png\" /><span>Login</span></h1>\n<!<![endif]-->\n<!--[if gt IE 8]>\n    <h1><img class=\"logo\" src=\"images/logo.svg\" alt=\"\"  /><span>Login</span></h1>\n<!<![endif]-->\n<!--[if !IE]><!-->\n    <h1><img class=\"logo\" src=\"images/logo.svg\" alt=\"\" /><span>Login</span></h1>\n<!--<![endif]-->\n\n```\n\n## The gotcha\n\nThis is good, we have an SVG where we can and a PNG where we just can’t. Now comes the gotcha: IE looks for a `viewBox` attribute on an svg in order to correctly scale it. Only some SVG creation and editing programs include this attribute; note that Inkscape does not by default. So, we must ensure that this attribute is present. SVG images are just markup so we can open them in our favorite text editors.

When we use this fixed SVG, IE will scale it as we would hope. Otherwise, if the `viewBox` line is not in your SVG, IE will clip your SVG at the size your were expecting to scale too.",

            "slug": "smart-sass-dynamic-sass-variables-with-php-smarty",
            "markdown": "Sass is a language which makes use of server-side compilation in order to generate CSS. Variables are one of the core features of Sass and allow us to specify reusable style definitions. However, what if we want the values of these variables to be assigned dynamically? To add some context to the issue, lets imagine that we have a site but we would like for the client to define the background colour, font and text colour whilst also maintaining our nicely formatted Sass file. Well, here's how:\n\nFirstly, we will need to add a third layer of architecture to our CSS generation for which we will need a server side templating language. For the purposes of this article we will use the PHP templating engine 'Smarty'.  Using Smarty we can now create, what I'm calling **Smart Sass** files using the Smarty variable notation `{$myVariable}`.  Couple this with Sass variable declarations and we end up with the Smarty template file looking something like this:\n\n```css\n$font: {$myFont};\n$textColour: {$myTextColour};\n$background: {$myBackground};\n\nbody {\n  font: $font;\n  color: $textColour;\n  background: $background;\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the Smarty and Sass variable syntax is very similar, this can actually cause a conflict and is discussed later in the article. Name this file something like styles.tpl ready for the next step: assigning values to our Smarty templates and compiling it to generate our Sass file.\n\nLet's now create a PHP function which will initalise an instance of Smarty and assign our template variables some values:\n\n```php\nfunction update_styles() {\n  require_once 'Smarty/libs/Smarty.class.php';\n\n  // Create Smarty object\n  $smarty = new Smarty();\n\n  // Here you should set some Smarty directories for caching, config and compiling etc.\n\n  // Set our Smarty template values\n  $smarty->assign('myFont', 'sans-serif');\n  $smarty->assign('myTextColour', '#000');\n  $smarty->assign('myBackground', 'yellow');\n}\n```\n\nOf course you will likely want to adapt the example above to, for example, retrieve the values from a form request and loop over the submitted values.\n\nNext, we want to be able to insert these values into the Smarty template we defined earlier, return the compiled output and write this value to our new, Sass formatted file.  To do this, we can append the following to our function:\n\n```php\n// Get compiled template output\n$data = $smarty->fetch('style.tpl');\n\n// Write compiled ouput to our SASS file\n$file = 'style.scss';\n$handle = fopen($file, 'w');\nfwrite($handle, $data);\nfclose($handle);\n```\n\nExecute this function and _tadahh!_ Check it out, we now have a `style.scss` Sass file filled out with all the variable values we assigned. **Note:** If you don't see a generated file there is probably something wrong with your file paths and/or permissions.\n\nWait, there's one last step. In order to generate the CSS from the Sass file we need to call the Compass compiler (Sass is built on this).  To do this I called the following PHP function where $dir is the location for where our Sass project lives:\n\n```php\nexec(\"compass compile $dir\");\n```\n\nDone! We now have an automated system for generating Sass files based on our dynamic input.\n\n## Things to keep in mind with this approach\n\n1. The process is one-way meaning that if we start modifying the output Sass file, we cannot reverse our process in order to generate an equivalent Smarty template (or whichever templating engine you decide to use).  In other words, recompiling our Smart Sass files would lose any changes that were made directly to the `style.scss` file.  All this really means is that you should remember to only update the code at top layer - the Smart Sass files. This way,  our changes will trickle down the process flow correctly.\n\n2. The web user will need permissions to write to the output Sass file(s) and Smarty compilation directory (refer to the Smarty docs for how to get started and configure such options).\n\n## Avoiding a Sass+Smarty conflict\n\nBeing so alike, it is possible for the SASS and Smarty syntaxes to collide; specifically SASS allows the following `#{$variable}`.\n\nI was able to avoid this feature by limiting Smarty to only compiling a partial Sass file  \\_vars.scss which stores all the variable definitions.  This approach means we can limit the amount of additional compilation needed and  potentially separate static and dynamic Sass variables. This means -- as long as you're careful -- the syntax conflict can be avoided.\n\n## But we already have a PHP port of Sass\n\nYes they do exist ([phpsass](https://packagist.org/packages/richthegeek/phpsass)). However, they rely on continuous maintenance to bring them in-line with the Sass compiler.  That said, if this isn't really a concern, it may be a better fit and is one I haven't fully explored.",

We now have an automated system for generating Sass files based on our dynamic input.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thingstokeepinmindwiththisapproach\">Things to keep in mind with this approach</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The process is one-way meaning that if we start modifying the output Sass file, we cannot reverse our process in order to generate an equivalent Smarty template (or whichever templating engine you decide to use).  In other words, recompiling our Smart Sass files would lose any changes that were made directly to the <code>style.scss</code> file.  All this really means is that you should remember to only update the code at top layer - the Smart Sass files. This way,  our changes will trickle down the process flow correctly.</p></li>\n<li><p>The web user will need permissions to write to the output Sass file(s) and Smarty compilation directory (refer to the Smarty docs for how to get started and configure such options).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"avoidingasasssmartyconflict\">Avoiding a Sass+Smarty conflict</h2>\n\n<p>Being so alike, it is possible for the SASS and Smarty syntaxes to collide; specifically SASS allows the following <code>#{$variable}</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I was able to avoid this feature by limiting Smarty to only compiling a partial Sass file  _vars.scss which stores all the variable definitions.  This approach means we can limit the amount of additional compilation needed and  potentially separate static and dynamic Sass variables. This means -- as long as you're careful -- the syntax conflict can be avoided.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"butwealreadyhaveaphpportofsass\">But we already have a PHP port of Sass</h2>\n\n<p>Yes they do exist (<a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/richthegeek/phpsass\">phpsass</a>). However, they rely on continuous maintenance to bring them in-line with the Sass compiler.  That said, if this isn't really a concern, it may be a better fit and is one I haven't fully explored.</p>",

Naturally, I reached for the [Cordova File Plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file), as a handful of cursory Google searches revealed it to be the *de facto* plugin for this task. However: its documentation, while talking about the plugin's quirks, is lacking in examples, the main [blog post it points to for usage](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/) is old, and not all of it is relevant to the plugin. In this post, I aim to detail what I have learned, to make it easier for other people to get started with this useful plugin.\n\n## The API Has It\n\nA great API is simple, and a joy to work with. Here is an example:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem('myKey', JSON.stringify({ my: 'data' }, null, '\\t'));\n\nvar data = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\nif (data) {\n\tdata = JSON.parse(data);\n}\n```\n\nNow, admittedly, it's a bit of a shame that the object to JSON conversion isn't done automatically, but all in all, the localStorage API is succint and developer friendly. With the Cordova File Plugin, things get more complicated.\n\n## HTML5 File API Et Al\n\nThe File Plugin implements the [HTML5 File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/), plus several others, many of which are since defunct. The result is a very versatile plugin, with low-level access to much functionality. The flip-side is that basic read/write operations (arguably the lion's share of all use cases), are not obvious, nor their usage consistent.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the [HTML5 Rocks FileSystem](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/) article is linked to for usage examples. That article concerns itself with how one would use the API in a browser. What it doesn't say in that article, or in the plugin documentation, is that the plugin takes care of some of the boilerplate you have to contend with when trying to use the File API in a browser.\n\n## Case In Point\n\nIn a browser, the File API requires you to:\n\n1. request a filesystem,\n2. specify whether it is to be temporary, or persistent,\n3. specify its size,\n4. specify success and error handlers for this request.\n\n```javascript\nfunction onInitFs(fs) {\n\tconsole.log('Opened file system: ' + fs.name);\n}\n\nwindow.requestFileSystem = window.requestFileSystem || window.webkitRequestFileSystem;\nwindow.requestFileSystem(window.PERSISTENT, 50*1024*1024 /*50MB*/, onInitFs, errorHandler);\n```\n\nFurthermore, if you requested a persistent filesystem, you also need to request storage quota from the user:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.webkitStorageInfo.requestQuota(PERSISTENT, 1024*1024, function (grantedBytes) {\n\twindow.requestFileSystem(window.PERSISTENT, grantedBytes, onInitFs, errorHandler);\n}, function (e) {\n\tconsole.log('Error', e);\n});\n```\n\n## The Important Part\n\nHere is what neither the HTML5 Rocks article (sensibly, since its concern is the browser API), nor the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file#cordova-plugin-file), nor some of the [very few example usage articles](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22336352/how-do-you-store-a-file-locally-using-apache-cordova-3-4-0), say:\n\n**You don't need either of those two steps when using the Cordova File Plugin.**\n\nOnly this [collection](http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/07/15/Cordova-Sample-Reading-a-text-file) of [example use cases](http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/11/05/Cordova-Example-Writing-to-a-file) hints at their superfluity.\n\nWith the Cordova File Plugin, there are two essential pieces of information to remember:\n\n1. Like all Cordova plugins, you have to wait for the `deviceready` event before you try anything,\n2. Then, `window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(<path>, <successHandler>, <errorHandler>)` is your friend.\n\n`window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL()` returns a `FileEntry` or `DirectoryEntry` instance (depending on whether you gave a file or a directory as path as its first parameter), which you can then work with.\n\n## Reading the Contents of a File\n\nThis the first of the two main use cases, the other one being writing a file. For this example, we assume a plain text file with some JSON in it. It's pretty much the same for any other plain text file, whereas it gets a little more complicated should you wish to read binary data.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n\tfunction readFromFile(fileName, cb) {\n\t\tvar pathToFile = cordova.file.dataDirectory + fileName;\n\t\twindow.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(pathToFile, function (fileEntry) {\n\t\t\tfileEntry.file(function (file) {\n\t\t\t\tvar reader = new FileReader();\n\n\t\t\t\treader.onloadend = function (e) {\n\t\t\t\t\tcb(JSON.parse(this.result));\n\t\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\t\treader.readAsText(file);\n\t\t\t}, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n\t\t}, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n\t}\n\n\tvar fileData;\n\treadFromFile('data.json', function (data) {\n\t\tfileData = data;\n\t});\n}\n```\n\nLet's have a look at a few of the things going on in this snippet.\n\nFirstly, we wait for the `deviceready` event. In your app, you have likely done this already way before you start any reading or writing of files, but it's important to remember.\n\nSecondly, we construct a path for `window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL()` with the magic `cordova.file.dataDirectory` value that the File Plugin exposes for us. This is one of several values for the various paths your app can access. They are [well documented](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file#where-to-store-files) on the Plugin page. In this case, it's a private data directory within your app's filesystem that won't sync with iCloud. (If you want this iOS only functionality, use `cordova.file.syncedDataDirectory`.)\n\nThen come a bunch of complicated, confusingly labelled, functions, instances, and event handlers. Essentially though, we're calling `readAsText()` on our file pointer, after having set up an event handler for the `loadend` event, which will be triggered when `readAsText()` reaches the end of the file. Its parameter is the event object, and the `this` context contains our data in its `result` property. You can also find it at `e.target.result`.\n\nMakes you a little jealous of localStorage's `getItem()` method, doesn't it? :)\n\n### What's With That Error Handler?\n\nYou might have noticed that `errorHandler.bind(null, fileName)` parameter on two of the function calls. Here is the function, much the same as in the HTML5 Rocks article, with one improvement.\n\n```javascript\nvar errorHandler = function (fileName, e) {\n\tvar msg = '';\n\n\tswitch (e.code) {\n\t\tcase FileError.QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'Storage quota exceeded';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase FileError.NOT_FOUND_ERR:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'File not found';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase FileError.SECURITY_ERR:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'Security error';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase FileError.INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'Invalid modification';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase FileError.INVALID_STATE_ERR:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'Invalid state';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tmsg = 'Unknown error';\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t};\n\n\tconsole.log('Error (' + fileName + '): ' + msg);\n}\n```\n\nBy itself, any error handler you specify is passed an error object as parameter, which holds little more than an error code. We're calling `.bind(null, fileName)` on the function when we specify it as the error handler, so that its first parameter becomes the filename instead. (The first argument to [`.bind`\n](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) is used for the context, passing `null` means it will default to the last bound `this` keyword, in this case `window`.)\n\n## Writing to a File\n\nHere then is the other obvious use case: writing some data to a file. In this example, we'll write some JSON. Here is the code:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n\tfunction writeToFile(fileName, data) {\n\t\tdata = JSON.stringify(data, null, '\\t');\n\t\twindow.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(cordova.file.dataDirectory, function (directoryEntry) {\n\t\t\tdirectoryEntry.getFile(fileName, { create: true }, function (fileEntry) {\n\t\t\t\tfileEntry.createWriter(function (fileWriter) {\n\t\t\t\t\tfileWriter.onwriteend = function (e) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// for real-world usage, you might consider passing a success callback\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log('Write of file \"' + fileName + '\"\" completed.');\n\t\t\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfileWriter.onerror = function (e) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// you could hook this up with our global error handler, or pass in an error callback\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log('Write failed: ' + e.toString());\n\t\t\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\t\t\tvar blob = new Blob([data], { type: 'text/plain' });\n\t\t\t\t\tfileWriter.write(blob);\n\t\t\t\t}, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n\t\t\t}, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n\t\t}, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n\t}\n\n\twriteToFile('example.json', { foo: 'bar' });\n}\n```\n\nA lot going on there, let's break it down.\n\nFor convenience, we're defining `writeToFile()` as a re-usable function. We're opening a connection to the dataDirectory, which returns a `directoryEntry` instance, with - amongst others - a `getFile()` method. We're calling this method with a filename, and a configuration object that tells the method to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nWe then call the `createWriter()` method on the `fileEntry` instance, which in turn gives us a `fileWriter` instance (phew). For illustration, I've set up 2 listeners on this instance, but as you can see they're not actually needed in this instance. What we're required to do is to create a new blob and write that to the file.\n\nThe first parameter for the Blob constructor is an array with our data as its sole item. This may seem odd in our case, but it is correct. I'll be honest - I've not gone through enough of the Blob spec to figure out why that is. The second argument is a configuration object, with a format type. Here, we specify `text/plain` (not, say, `application/json`) because that's what our file will be. Yes, the content will be JSON, but JSON is just plain text, and we're not telling the filesystem to interpret it (like we would if we were to serve it to a browser).\n\nAnd that's how you write your JSON to a file, and yes, it's rather different from reading a file.\n\n## Wishful API\n\nWe have seen that the File plugin's API and usage is complex. It allows for maximum versatility, but it's also based on defunct specifications, which might have been streamlined had they been examined further. I don't have the know-how to implement this for all the currently supported platforms of this plugin, but here's my suggestion (or wish) for an API that could sit on top on the current one.\n\n### Write or Append to a File\n\n```javascript\ncordova.file.write(fileName, data, { create: true }, successHandler, errorHandler);\ncordova.file.append(fileName, data, {}, successHandler, errorHandler); // with { create: true }, it would behave as .write() if previously non-existent\n```\n\n### Read a File's Contents\n\n```javascript\ncordova.file.read(fileName, { type: 'text/plain' }, successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\nThe fileName could either be an absolute path that the developer constructs using the various `cordova.file.*` locations that the plugin exposes, or, alternatively, be specified as part of the configuration object (the second parameter), e.g. `{ basePath: cordova.file.dataDirectory }`.\n\nIf one were to go down that route, I would additionally suggest being able to specify configuration options globally for an app:\n\n```javascript\ncordova.file.options({\n\tbasePath: cordova.file.dataDirectory, // working directory\n\tcreate: true, // always create files\n\ttype: 'text/plain' // read/write all files as plain text\n});\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe code above is the result of several days' of reading documentation, trawling through blog posts, and experimentation. For all I know, I'm still doing some things wrong.\n\nDevelopment in the world of Javascript moves at a rapid pace, and documentation doesn't always keep up. Add to that the fact that many front-end developers are smart, good-looking, and smell nice, and are often deeply involved with the technologies they're using themselves, it can sometimes be hard to break into a particular technology when coming to it for the first time.\n\nI remember a long time ago I was trying to write to a file in PHP. Sure enough, I had to open a pointer/handler to the file, seek around it, and then stream data to disk, before finally releasing the open handler again. Then, a while later, `file_put_contents()` and `file_get_contents()` came along and drastically simplified things for 99% of the use cases.\n\nSure it's nice to have all the power, but when designing APIs, ask yourselves what the main use cases are, and try and make those as easy and intuitive as possible. Then document them well.",

Here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);  \nfunction onDeviceReady() {  \n    function writeToFile(fileName, data) {\n        data = JSON.stringify(data, null, '\\t');\n        window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(cordova.file.dataDirectory, function (directoryEntry) {\n            directoryEntry.getFile(fileName, { create: true }, function (fileEntry) {\n                fileEntry.createWriter(function (fileWriter) {\n                    fileWriter.onwriteend = function (e) {\n                        // for real-world usage, you might consider passing a success callback\n                        console.log('Write of file \"' + fileName + '\"\" completed.');\n                    };\n\n                    fileWriter.onerror = function (e) {\n                        // you could hook this up with our global error handler, or pass in an error callback\n                        console.log('Write failed: ' + e.toString());\n                    };\n\n                    var blob = new Blob([data], { type: 'text/plain' });\n                    fileWriter.write(blob);\n                }, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n            }, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n        }, errorHandler.bind(null, fileName));\n    }\n\n    writeToFile('example.json', { foo: 'bar' });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A lot going on there, let's break it down.</p>\n\n<p>For convenience, we're defining <code>writeToFile()</code> as a re-usable function. We're opening a connection to the dataDirectory, which returns a <code>directoryEntry</code> instance, with - amongst others - a <code>getFile()</code> method. We're calling this method with a filename, and a configuration object that tells the method to create the file if it doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>We then call the <code>createWriter()</code> method on the <code>fileEntry</code> instance, which in turn gives us a <code>fileWriter</code> instance (phew). For illustration, I've set up 2 listeners on this instance, but as you can see they're not actually needed in this instance. What we're required to do is to create a new blob and write that to the file.</p>\n\n<p>The first parameter for the Blob constructor is an array with our data as its sole item. This may seem odd in our case, but it is correct. I'll be honest - I've not gone through enough of the Blob spec to figure out why that is. The second argument is a configuration object, with a format type. Here, we specify <code>text/plain</code> (not, say, <code>application/json</code>) because that's what our file will be. Yes, the content will be JSON, but JSON is just plain text, and we're not telling the filesystem to interpret it (like we would if we were to serve it to a browser).</p>\n\n<p>And that's how you write your JSON to a file, and yes, it's rather different from reading a file.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wishfulapi\">Wishful API</h2>\n\n<p>We have seen that the File plugin's API and usage is complex. It allows for maximum versatility, but it's also based on defunct specifications, which might have been streamlined had they been examined further. I don't have the know-how to implement this for all the currently supported platforms of this plugin, but here's my suggestion (or wish) for an API that could sit on top on the current one.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"writeorappendtoafile\">Write or Append to a File</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">cordova.file.write(fileName, data, { create: true }, successHandler, errorHandler);  \ncordova.file.append(fileName, data, {}, successHandler, errorHandler); // with { create: true }, it would behave as .write() if previously non-existent  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"readafilescontents\">Read a File's Contents</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">cordova.file.read(fileName, { type: 'text/plain' }, successHandler, errorHandler);  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The fileName could either be an absolute path that the developer constructs using the various <code>cordova.file.*</code> locations that the plugin exposes, or, alternatively, be specified as part of the configuration object (the second parameter), e.g. <code>{ basePath: cordova.file.dataDirectory }</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If one were to go down that route, I would additionally suggest being able to specify configuration options globally for an app:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">cordova.file.options({  \n    basePath: cordova.file.dataDirectory, // working directory\n    create: true, // always create files\n    type: 'text/plain' // read/write all files as plain text\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The code above is the result of several days' of reading documentation, trawling through blog posts, and experimentation. For all I know, I'm still doing some things wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Development in the world of Javascript moves at a rapid pace, and documentation doesn't always keep up. Add to that the fact that many front-end developers are smart, good-looking, and smell nice, and are often deeply involved with the technologies they're using themselves, it can sometimes be hard to break into a particular technology when coming to it for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>I remember a long time ago I was trying to write to a file in PHP. Sure enough, I had to open a pointer/handler to the file, seek around it, and then stream data to disk, before finally releasing the open handler again. Then, a while later, <code>file_put_contents()</code> and <code>file_get_contents()</code> came along and drastically simplified things for 99% of the use cases.</p>\n\n<p>Sure it's nice to have all the power, but when designing APIs, ask yourselves what the main use cases are, and try and make those as easy and intuitive as possible. Then document them well.</p>",

            "markdown": "It's a common scenario: You've built a new website locally to replace an older one, tested it fully (with your automated testing framework of choice), and now you're deploying it to a spanking new server it's going to live on. You're editing your local \"hosts\" file to tell your browser to resolve the domain name to the IP address of its new server, and you find that everything is well.\n\nThe next step is to change the DNS, so that the domain name points to the new server in the wild. Here's where it can get tricky. If you need to change the nameservers of the domain, then you're stuck with having to wait for the change to propagate throughout the net, and explaining to your client that it could take anywhere from an hour to a day.\n\nOn the other hand, if you can edit the DNS zone file directly, your changes will be instantaneous - on the nameserver. But here's the problem: All these shiny DNS entries in the zone file have a time-to-live (TTL) value (in seconds), and it's likely quite high, perhaps around 4 hours (14,400 seconds). So when your user agent tries to reach the domain, gets punted to its nameserver, who tells it that the \"A\" record for the domain points at a given IP address, it also says that this information is good for a certain period of time.\n\nBeing a good user agent, it caches that lookup for the length of time given (let's say 4 hours for this example). This reduces the load on the nameservers, and really speeds up future requests. But you can see where this is going - we've edited the zone file, but let's say the user agent got that information a few minutes before the change, and now it's got the old information, which it will rely on for another 3 hours and fifty-something minutes. Let's also say the user was in fact the client, and they want to see their new site, but they keep seeing the old site on the old server, and they're getting antsy.\n\n##So what can we do?\n\nWell, firstly, we can flush our local DNS cache. Try these commands in your OS's terminal or command window.\n\n###OS X Mavericks\n\n\tdscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n###Windows 7 & 8\n\n    ipconfig /flushdns\n\n###Ubuntu\n\nWell, Ubuntu doesn't cache DNS lookups.\n\nHowever, sometimes flushing your local DNS cache is only half the story. Your ISP might cache the lookups too, for example, and you'll have a hard time getting Virgin Media or BT flushing their DNS caches for you.\n\n##A better approach\n\nThis one requires a little forward planning, but it should make your site migrations that much easier.\n\nHave a look at the current time-to-live for your DNS entries (and not just \"A\", check your \"CNAME\"s and \"MX\" records too if applicable), and then, at at least twice that length of time (to account for overzealous cachers; after all, the TTL is merely a suggestion) before going live, set them to a small duration, such as 5 minutes (300 seconds).\n\nPerhaps doing this the day before is easiest. Now you're telling all user agents who look up records that the information you're giving them is only good for 5 minutes, so they'll come back and check it on the first new request every five minutes, and presto, when you go live and change the DNS, the users will see the new site within 5 minutes.\n\nDon't forget to change the TTL back to its normal value shortly after you've changed the DNS to point at the new server. In fact, you could do it at the same time, since this new information is now supposed to be canonical. However, you might be better server leaving it for a little while, in case you run into any problems that require a rollback to the old server. In this case, the rollback would only take up to 5 minutes for individual users.\n\n##Any drawbacks or pitfalls?\n\nUnfortunately yes, there are two main gotchas with this technique. Firstly, you can never be fully sure that the DNS caches respect the TTLs they're given. Your ISP might set a default cache duration regardless, for example.\n\nSecondly, for the duration of the short TTLs, you're hammering your nameserver much more than usual. DNS lookups are cheap, and your host's nameservers should be up to the task (and indeed that's why you have at least two of them per domain name), but it's worth bearing in mind. You certainly don't want to forget resetting the TTLs.\n\nWith all that in mind, this is still a handy technique.\n",

If you don't have an existing body of user research for us to work from, we'll often start by developing personas. Personas are fictitious characters developed out of research into the people your project is aimed at. \n\nWe'll start to shape our ideas of what the project should do by working with these personas and the scenarios we put them through, and reviewing those insights with you and the people people who'll use the software the project will produce. We've often found it useful to our work in identifying user needs to work with potential project users in these sessions: the use of personas seems to make it easier for people to articulate needs, rather than wants.\n\n## User stories\n\nUser stories help keep us on target to understand what people need to do. \"As a...\" \"I would like to be able to\"... \"So that I can...\" is a common format for a user story. That format demands we understand every feature in terms of its value to someone who will actually use it. The art, to us, is in keeping those stories broad enough so as not to demand a certain implementation, yet narrow enough to be doable reasonably quickly, so we waste a little as possible of our time. \n\n## Prototyping\n\nWe're huge fans of paper-prototyping at this stage of the process. Lo-fi, democratising and fast to change: paper prototyping helps us make rapid strides in defining how we'll meet the user needs we're refining during Discovery. Those prototypes get tested by users and radically altered before we hit a line of code.\n\n## Prioritisation\n\nWe aim not to spend much time on estimation: simply to be able to accurately answer the question: what delivers the most value? That takes an understanding of what the project aims to do, and what the needs of your users are. That sets out what we need to do first, and we keep prioritising until we believe we've bitten off enough work for our first sprint of development effort.",

Using a simple model of a couple of workshops and some thinking funded by the [Big Lottery fund](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/), we’ve been helping them set the direction for introducing digital solutions into their [Rose Voucher](http://www.alexandrarose.org.uk/rose-vouchers) schemes.\n\nThe Rose Vouchers for Fruit & Veg scheme supports families on low incomes to access a healthy diet and avoid food poverty. The project works in partnership with local children’s centres to distribute vouchers to families in need which can only be redeemed for fresh fruit & veg at participating local markets.  With great qualitative and quantitative evaluation data, the Rose Voucher schemes are in high demand. Several cities have recently competed to be the next to get in on the action.\n\nHowever with a process reliant on paper vouchers, shoeboxes, 3 different Excel spreadsheets, and lynchpin volunteers standing in post office queues, the team behind the project have become very aware that to scale and spread the benefits of their work, they need to look to digital development.\n\nOur first workshop was with the core team who administer the scheme, and the second with those outside the organisation who get the benefits of the scheme to those in need - including a mix of volunteers and staff from children’s centres and council market teams.\n\nUsing journey mapping of existing processes and spending a lot of time recording and validating the pain points those journeys create, we came up with the following observations which are helping us shape a fundraising plan for digital enhancements to Rose Vouchers:\n\n1) Varying areas have varying requirements for implementation of the scheme\n\n> \"We don’t work like that here\"\n\nThe project has a commitment to working with local authorities, and requires them to recognise and support the benefits that Rose Vouchers can bring to those in their area who are most in need. Different authorities and markets prefer different methods of implementing the scheme, and their requirements may present a barrier to national reach. Any digital development needs to retain some flexibility in order to devise different processes to suit different local authorities.\n\n2) Implementation details may be different in the same area at different points in the project's lifetime.\n\n> \"We’re about to get iZettle across the market - so now it would be good to see if we could have Rose Voucher cards - but if you’d asked me last year…\"\n\nTraders are a key user group for the schemes’ success. Implementation typically starts on a small scale and grows from there, propelled by market traders as advocates. Extensive set-up investment in money or time will disrupt this pattern, and this advocacy. Any digital development must be sympathetic to this.\n\n3) Personal contact at the Children's Centre is an important output of the project\n\n> \"Don't make me stamp any more vouchers\"\n\nThe time taken to sign up participants, and then to regularly distribute physical vouchers, is seen as onerous. However, it's also a welcome motivator for a visit which might not occur in an entirely digital solution with no requirement for physical presence. Every visit is an opportunity for the centre staff to chat with participants about the challenges they face in their lives, and make them aware of other services that might help.  Some of the stages appear to be seen as overly onerous, possibly because the benefit of those particular elements of the process are ill-explored or poorly communicated.\n\n4) Children's centres have a wide variety of network access and IT infrastructure.\n\n> \"I don't really mind doing this for the good of the scheme, but isn't there an easier way?\"\n\nChildren's centre staff have varying degrees of comfort with digital solutions, and while the current paper solution is viewed as onerous, a prospective digital solution is not universally welcome either due to perceived and actual issues with IT infrastructure. Robustness in the face of hardware and network failure is a key consideration in the success of any digital intervention.\n\n5) Recipients may not always find it easy to spend their vouchers.\n\n> \"Are they going to take my voucher or will they laugh at me?\"\n\nThere is a pain point for recipients in identifying firstly which traders take the vouchers and secondly, which will treat them well. While this may not be a problem that technology can – or should – solve, it may form an adjunct to a piece of development with other benefits.\n\n6) Traders are concerned with reliability and speed at the point of sale.\n\n> \"I'd do it straight away, but my dad won't touch an app.\"\n\nMarkets are rarely equipped to use electronic devices at the point of sale, nor are moves to make them so welcomed by all traders. The challenges of network access and connectivity may not affect them as seriously as recipients, but they are still real issues. Should a sale be lost to a shoddy network connection, then the scheme will lose goodwill.\n\n7) Traders and those who work with them are looking for speedy redemption\n\n> \"Don't make me stand in the post office queue any more.\"\n\nTraders live in a cash economy; often their wholesalers only accept cash, so fast access to money from voucher sales is important. Any change to the redemption process needs to speed this process rather than reduce it, as well as reducing the time taken by market reps. or council employees to administer the redemption.\n\n8) Administrators spend valuable time re-keying data\n\n> \"If the scheme gets much bigger I might not be able to do this anymore!\"\n\nThe audit trail for a voucher is created in a manual process, involving 3 different excel spreadsheets held by 2 different organisations, as well as hand written logs of voucher numbers that are then re-entered into these spreadsheets. Metrics are created at evaluation points by manipulation of the spreadsheets, and referring back to paper based data. The system is effective under conscientious administration but will not scale well.\n\nThe next stage of the project is to add depth to some ideas for elements of the existing process which can be augmented with digital solutions. We're also interested in how Rose Vouchers scheme sits in the wider landscape of assistance for people with these challenges in their lives. With some lovely serendipity, we came across a post on the [Digital Health blog](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/) which talks about [a discovery phase](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/14/healthy-start-learned/) for the [Healthy Start programme](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/22/healthy-start-discovery/)  - and look forward to sharing more learning along to way to an alpha solution.

            "markdown": "\nNeontribe are big fans of open data, and last summer we got involved with a fascinating project using never-before-published data from the charitable sector. Our work made us revisit one of our fundamental assumptions about the goal of a user interface.\n\nThe opportunity came about thanks to a recommendation from a colleague at [Open Data Services](http://www.opendataservices.coop/), Steven Flower. Steven and his team, well-known for their work on the [OpenContracting Helpdesk](http://www.open-contracting.org/) and the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://www.aidtransparency.net/), were working with [360Giving](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/), a new initiative that supports organisations to publish their grants data and helps people to understand and use that data to improve decision making. 360Giving had already created a data standard and a data quality checking tool (CoVE) and engaged with some of the UK’s biggest and most influential donors including the Big Lottery Fund,  BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief. Their next piece of development was to be [GrantNav:](http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/) an open access tool that allows anyone to explore the data published to the 360Giving Standard. When 360Giving approached us, the GrantNav project was ready for some user research.\n![](/content/images/2017/01/GrantNav.jpg)\n\nThe techniques we used would be familiar to anyone working in the field; starting with the creation of persona based on phone calls to some of the data publishers. These were then validated at a workshop which also explored story maps of journeys using the tool and the parallel journeys being taken in different types of charity offices across the sector. Once a beta of GrantNav was available, we also ran usability testing at various charity offices. These tests were flexible, carried out with both new and returning GrantNav users, and had as much value as a means of engaging with data publishers and discussing their overall interest in opening up their data as they did in exploring users' responses to the tool.\n\nTogether with 360Giving and Open Data Services, we started out with a goal common to every project team – let’s make a delightful, intuitive tool that everyone can use from the moment they land on its home page. However, our research caused us to collectively question not only how to achieve that, but whether, in this case, it should even be the development goal.\n\nWe thought that sharing some of the insights that led to this conclusion might be interesting to other teams doing similar work.\n\nOur newest user researcher (me, Kat, writing this post) was gobsmacked when reporting back a no doubt common revelation about search in 2016. “Nobody uses quotation marks any more”. Never on their first search, and often not even after having exhausted every other option the interface seemed to offer to narrow their criteria down. This, combined with the common truth that many users only pay attention to a tiny proportion of what’s on the screen in front of them led to our first big discovery: \n\nIt was remarkably common when watching a user who was asked to search for an organisation’s funding history, to observe them type that organisation’s name into the search bar, hit go, scroll through their first few results, and ignore all the information about number, value, size of grants, recipients and funders shown above the search results. Believing they’d successfully isolated the data they wanted, they'd then and go right ahead and download a CSV file which additionally included over 5,000 different organisations that have received funds, each one sharing a part of the title of the organisation they'd originally searched for.\n\nWhy does this happen? We think it’s a function of an observation we don't think we're the first to make: that people want every search tool they use to “work like Google”. Unfortunately, in this particular case the way we use the internet, and particularly sites we often search or filter (eg jobs, holiday, house moving and shopping) teaches us expectations that are not always useful for data exploration tasks. Put more simply, the way we use Google and similar tools to find “one, or the best of something” does not help us when we are trying to find “all of something and nothing else” because we’ve trained our instincts for the former type of task.\n\nIt's true there are huge advantages to the fact that GrantNav mirrors the use of facets on familiar sites like Guardian Jobs or Rightmove. Those users with their CSVs of 5,000 organisations weren’t put off the tool. They were quick to explore other tasks, browse those “left hand lists”, find out what criteria they could view the data using, whether they are exclusive choices or whether they work together, and how they interact with the free text search on the data. So we didn’t think the right response to the stumbling blocks was to change the methodology from the ground up. After all, those users had only downloaded “one click too early”. Once shown their error, and how to follow a link directly to a recipient organisation’s funding history, they didn’t make the same mistake again.\n\nInstead, we began to move towards a realisation. For GrantNav, we should not be overly concerned that the route to success to any individual task might not always be smooth. Sacrilegious in UX terms? \n\nMaybe, but we are adamant it is right for this product and its users.\nGrantNav is not a tool with a single function that needs to ensure users complete an end to end journey. It’s an interface to a massive dataset, that has never been published to a single standard before, and which can be interrogated in almost endless ways. Attempts to simplify the tool would restrict this range of use. \n\nMore importantly, we rapidly became subscribers to the view that the idea that any of the websites and tools we use on a daily basis are instinctive is folly for most users. We don’t learn to use Facebook and Twitter to their fullest extent because their features are self-explanatory.

            "html": "<p>Neontribe are big fans of open data, and last summer we got involved with a fascinating project using never-before-published data from the charitable sector. Our work made us revisit one of our fundamental assumptions about the goal of a user interface.</p>\n\n<p>The opportunity came about thanks to a recommendation from a colleague at <a href=\"http://www.opendataservices.coop/\">Open Data Services</a>, Steven Flower. Steven and his team, well-known for their work on the <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\">OpenContracting Helpdesk</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a>, were working with <a href=\"http://www.threesixtygiving.org/\">360Giving</a>, a new initiative that supports organisations to publish their grants data and helps people to understand and use that data to improve decision making. 360Giving had already created a data standard and a data quality checking tool (CoVE) and engaged with some of the UK’s biggest and most influential donors including the Big Lottery Fund,  BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief. Their next piece of development was to be <a href=\"http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/\">GrantNav:</a> an open access tool that allows anyone to explore the data published to the 360Giving Standard. When 360Giving approached us, the GrantNav project was ready for some user research. <br />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2017/01/GrantNav.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The techniques we used would be familiar to anyone working in the field; starting with the creation of persona based on phone calls to some of the data publishers. These were then validated at a workshop which also explored story maps of journeys using the tool and the parallel journeys being taken in different types of charity offices across the sector. Once a beta of GrantNav was available, we also ran usability testing at various charity offices. These tests were flexible, carried out with both new and returning GrantNav users, and had as much value as a means of engaging with data publishers and discussing their overall interest in opening up their data as they did in exploring users' responses to the tool.</p>\n\n<p>Together with 360Giving and Open Data Services, we started out with a goal common to every project team – let’s make a delightful, intuitive tool that everyone can use from the moment they land on its home page. However, our research caused us to collectively question not only how to achieve that, but whether, in this case, it should even be the development goal.</p>\n\n<p>We thought that sharing some of the insights that led to this conclusion might be interesting to other teams doing similar work.</p>\n\n<p>Our newest user researcher (me, Kat, writing this post) was gobsmacked when reporting back a no doubt common revelation about search in 2016. “Nobody uses quotation marks any more”. Never on their first search, and often not even after having exhausted every other option the interface seemed to offer to narrow their criteria down. This, combined with the common truth that many users only pay attention to a tiny proportion of what’s on the screen in front of them led to our first big discovery: </p>\n\n<p>It was remarkably common when watching a user who was asked to search for an organisation’s funding history, to observe them type that organisation’s name into the search bar, hit go, scroll through their first few results, and ignore all the information about number, value, size of grants, recipients and funders shown above the search results. Believing they’d successfully isolated the data they wanted, they'd then and go right ahead and download a CSV file which additionally included over 5,000 different organisations that have received funds, each one sharing a part of the title of the organisation they'd originally searched for.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this happen? We think it’s a function of an observation we don't think we're the first to make: that people want every search tool they use to “work like Google”. Unfortunately, in this particular case the way we use the internet, and particularly sites we often search or filter (eg jobs, holiday, house moving and shopping) teaches us expectations that are not always useful for data exploration tasks. Put more simply, the way we use Google and similar tools to find “one, or the best of something” does not help us when we are trying to find “all of something and nothing else” because we’ve trained our instincts for the former type of task.</p>\n\n<p>It's true there are huge advantages to the fact that GrantNav mirrors the use of facets on familiar sites like Guardian Jobs or Rightmove. Those users with their CSVs of 5,000 organisations weren’t put off the tool. They were quick to explore other tasks, browse those “left hand lists”, find out what criteria they could view the data using, whether they are exclusive choices or whether they work together, and how they interact with the free text search on the data. So we didn’t think the right response to the stumbling blocks was to change the methodology from the ground up. After all, those users had only downloaded “one click too early”. Once shown their error, and how to follow a link directly to a recipient organisation’s funding history, they didn’t make the same mistake again.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we began to move towards a realisation. For GrantNav, we should not be overly concerned that the route to success to any individual task might not always be smooth. Sacrilegious in UX terms? </p>\n\n<p>Maybe, but we are adamant it is right for this product and its users. <br />\nGrantNav is not a tool with a single function that needs to ensure users complete an end to end journey. It’s an interface to a massive dataset, that has never been published to a single standard before, and which can be interrogated in almost endless ways. Attempts to simplify the tool would restrict this range of use. </p>\n\n<p>More importantly, we rapidly became subscribers to the view that the idea that any of the websites and tools we use on a daily basis are instinctive is folly for most users. We don’t learn to use Facebook and Twitter to their fullest extent because their features are self-explanatory. Instead, we learn to use them because the internet provides countless “top tips” blogs that teach us new things to do, we learn to use them because a friend shows us how a certain feature works and we learn to use them because the cost of getting something wrong is small, and we find the process and results interesting enough to experiment.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset behind GrantNav is complex.

Participants pair up to take on challenges in either the primary (KS2) or the lower secondary (KS3) age  group competitions, and a range of primary and high schools across Norfolk signed up for the challenge. Overall, over 100 kids were involved in the day, with a fair number of their teachers and independent judges on hand to guide and assist. \n\n![](/content/images/2017/07/DSC_0608.JPG)\n \nThis year, I had the privilege to represent Neontribe and judge the primary age group competitions, as well as hand out 2 prizes – this year, some Raspberry Pi starter kits. There were 2 challenges for the lower age group: a prepared game, and an unseen challenge. The unseen challenge had to be completed during the morning of the competition, during which the prepared game would also be inspected by the judging team. Then, in the afternoon session, the finalists for each task demonstrated their attempts to the judges and everyone else, with prize-winners subsequently announced. \n \nAs for the challenges themselves, the prepared game had to involve 3 unique levels or mini-games, all wrapped up in the same program. This gave the kids a great opportunity to create stories and narratives to give their games more meaning. Amongst my favourite of the attempts featured a scared knight trying to avoid hosts of different horrible creatures!  \n \nThe unprepared challenge was for the pairs to create a drawing tool application, featuring a frog, and to be controlled via using the keyboard arrow keys. Some of the pairs progressed so well that the frogs could even have different line colours and thicknesses, and different backdrops on which to draw - although I don't think it's realistic to expect frogs to live too long in a deep sea underwater environment! \n\n![](/content/images/2017/07/DSC_0196-1.JPG)\n \nAll of the programming was done by using <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/about\">Scratch</a>, which helps young people get into programming in a fun and engaging way; many schools have adopted it for their classes, as there is little setup overhead. There are always great beginning Scratch resources available freely online which do a great job of introducing a kid into programming!  \n\nI always find it refreshing to see how kids tackle challenges! Even with some limited experience, each of the pre-prepared games I saw were humorous and engaging. Another great thing about the primary school entrants was the number of girls taking part, and indeed the high proportion of mixed gender pairs who were able to bounce different ideas off one idea in a highly constructive way. \n \nHere's to the future and to the next wave of programmers!",

Overall, over 100 kids were involved in the day, with a fair number of their teachers and independent judges on hand to guide and assist. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/07/DSC_0608.JPG\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>This year, I had the privilege to represent Neontribe and judge the primary age group competitions, as well as hand out 2 prizes – this year, some Raspberry Pi starter kits. There were 2 challenges for the lower age group: a prepared game, and an unseen challenge. The unseen challenge had to be completed during the morning of the competition, during which the prepared game would also be inspected by the judging team. Then, in the afternoon session, the finalists for each task demonstrated their attempts to the judges and everyone else, with prize-winners subsequently announced. </p>\n\n<p>As for the challenges themselves, the prepared game had to involve 3 unique levels or mini-games, all wrapped up in the same program. This gave the kids a great opportunity to create stories and narratives to give their games more meaning. Amongst my favourite of the attempts featured a scared knight trying to avoid hosts of different horrible creatures!  </p>\n\n<p>The unprepared challenge was for the pairs to create a drawing tool application, featuring a frog, and to be controlled via using the keyboard arrow keys. Some of the pairs progressed so well that the frogs could even have different line colours and thicknesses, and different backdrops on which to draw - although I don't think it's realistic to expect frogs to live too long in a deep sea underwater environment! </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/07/DSC_0196-1.JPG\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>All of the programming was done by using <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/about\">Scratch</a>, which helps young people get into programming in a fun and engaging way; many schools have adopted it for their classes, as there is little setup overhead. There are always great beginning Scratch resources available freely online which do a great job of introducing a kid into programming!  </p>\n\n<p>I always find it refreshing to see how kids tackle challenges! Even with some limited experience, each of the pre-prepared games I saw were humorous and engaging. Another great thing about the primary school entrants was the number of girls taking part, and indeed the high proportion of mixed gender pairs who were able to bounce different ideas off one idea in a highly constructive way. </p>\n\n<p>Here's to the future and to the next wave of programmers!</p>",

            "markdown": "Here at Neontribe, we always want to help young people enter the world of web development. Amongst other things, we have been running a Computer club at Bacton Primary school (see <a href=\"/coding-with-kids/\">our blog on this</a>). And from this, we have created a series of programming tasks that will result in a complete version of the popular game, 'Snake'. \n \nWe are now offering up the chance for anyone to use our 'Snake Game Challenge' resources to help an aspiring developer get to grips with some basic coding practices - using just a terminal, an internet browser and the Python language! (Skip to the <a href=\"#ref1\">bottom of this page</a> to see where they are.) \n \nFirstly however, a little introduction to our approach: \n \nMany primary school computer clubs use <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/about\">Scratch</a>, to help kids learn more about programming. Our approach at Bacton primary school was different however, for many reasons. Although Scratch has many distinct advantages - it is fun and viscerally engaging, and takes away a lot of the setup overhead to allow users to focus on the joy of making things happen with code, it also misses out some of the fundamental steps of coding. One of the fundamental skills for any programmer is the ability to type out lines of code precisely - a single character out of place and the whole program may fail. At Bacton, our focus was on a step-by-step journey through typing out all of the required lines of code, explaining and reminding the children of key concepts along the way.  \n \nThis combination of covering concepts generally whilst being precise in each step is more reflective of programming generally, and makes the task of exposing young children to actual code less frightening, if they are actually writing it out themselves. This is in contrast to the 'drag and drop' visual approach taken by Scratch, which has more of a 'designing code' focus. \n \nSo, our aim is for the kids to type out full working programs. We always write in Python, an easy to learn and use language. Also, we always take advantage of a free-to-use online project management tool called <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>. Trello is frequently used by us here at Neontribe, and with its checklist feature, we can 'tick' each coding task as completed as it is written out. \n \nThis made lesson planning and overall progress assessment easier, as well as breaking up the way we approached teaching the material. At Bacton, we had one kid read out the instruction, one type it, and another click on the Trello board to say the task had completed! This is a great strategy if you have limited PCs and lots of students simultaneously involved. \n \nFurthermore, by giving clear instructions as to what to type, we have the further advantage of appealing to a range of children, in terms of abilities and age - some of our students were KS2 and hardly had much exposure to typing on a keyboard. Other, older students had a basic understanding of programming concepts such as: variables, if/else statements, and debugging, to name a few.  \n \nRecently, I was tasked with finding another challenge for the kids. Looking for a simplistic yet addictive game, I remember (from a long time ago!) 'Snake' on the Nokia 3310 (pictured, above). Furthermore, I saw <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sanchitgangwar/2158089\">an example of Snake written in a single Python file </a>. Drawing heavily upon this, I produced a simpler version, and broke up the coding of it into 8 distinct chunks or features of the game. All you need is a terminal or application that can run Python files! \n \nThe code here is by no means perfect, but should appeal to junior developers with different levels of experience - especially if guided by a more experienced programmer. And there are lots of possibilities to extend the game further than its current state! \n \nWhere is it?  \n \nTo find the resources, <a id=\"ref1\" href=\"https://github.com/georgedeeks/SnakeGameChallenge\">click here</a>.

            "markdown": "In 2016 Neontribe did a [little discovery work](https://www.neontribe.co.uk/discovery-and-direction/ \"A blog post about Discovery\") for the Alexandra Rose charity. Their core project is the Rose Voucher scheme, which helps parents with young children on low incomes to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from market stalls.\n\nBy the end of that work we knew (thankfully) that we weren’t aiming to build an app that helped parents locate and rate stalls and share recipes. We needed instead to focus on digitising a paper voucher system that was full of repetitive work, and would not scale at all well as the charity grew the number of areas it was working in.\n\nOur [bid to Comic Relief’s tech-for-good funding](https://www.comicrelief.com/grants/tech-for-good/ \"tech-for-good funding\")  allows us to build on that work, focusing on moving the reimbursement of market traders from paper vouchers to a digital system, saving time and money and helping the project to expand.\n\n“You need chargeable cards” you might think, as we did, very briefly, in the early discovery phase.   \n\nHowever a crucial element of the Rose Voucher project is dignity for the recipients. Their early project evaluations show that “feeling accepted as customers” is an important element of retention on the scheme. Since most of the markets have no point of sale technology (and amongst those that do, take up among fruit and veg trader is low) handing over vouchers is the best way for scheme members to shop “like everyone else”. \n\nSo by the time we started on the Comic Relief project, we knew that we needed to retain paper vouchers within the process - we just had to help somebody get the information from the voucher into a digital system where payment can be requested - and then present that information in a format that’ll be useful for the next step along the process.\n\nBefore we began we’d already done a bit of user research with a handful of traders in Brixton market who knew the scheme. We’d given them a mobile phone that could scan vouchers, a laptop with a barcode scanner, and some vouchers for them to start scanning…\n\nBarcodes - we thought - were our most likely solution - reducing error from writing down voucher numbers. However the user research showed just how slow phone based scanners were - and how unwieldy to use on a stall with vouchers blowing in the wind. Whilst the handheld supermarket style scanner was more promising, that would mean laptop or tablet tech on the stall, and power to run both - possibly not ideal.\n\nAnd so the Comic Relief project began. We had planned a four month project - a month each on discovery, alpha then beta development, then a short private beta programme to learn some more. \n\nAfter the Comic Relief kick-off day in Manchester, looking at all the discovery we’d already done we ripped up that plan and set off in a new direction. We found we already knew enough to start coding and designing a rough interface. We could start coding quicker, and spread our building, measuring and learning out at little more.\n\nA new question had come up: “Could typing in voucher codes actually be the simplest way to streamline this process?”.  It was definitely a good place to start technically - whatever method people used to get vouchers in a system, it’d boil down to an entry in a datastore, and a text entry box is a very easy bit of code to write. But could simple text entry actually meet user needs too?\n\nAfter a fortnight, we started coding. After another fortnight, we had a scruffy alpha we could show a market trader - the \"mark one text box\", which simply let a market trader add the code from a voucher to a list using a text entry field on a phone. So could the textbox actually stand up to being used? What would we learn?\n\nFirst up, we watched how traders actually used a phone for data entry. To our surprise, it looked *easier* to use native form controls - a phone number pad - to enter the code than it had to try and use a mobile phone scanner. There was no trouble with wrinkled vouchers, no juggling vouchers from hand to hand, no vouchers blowing away in the wind.\n\nSecondly, we'd pre-filled the code entry boxes so that they start with the first five characters of the last voucher you recorded. This means no need to complete (or place ditto marks, as we had seen in user research) the part of the code which is used to specify scheme or area where a voucher was issues. And that means that entering a voucher code involves about half as many key presses and therefore it's twice as fast - except for the rare occasions when a voucher from outside the area shows up.\n\nSome traders thought it was “quicker than writing them down” but even those that weren’t sure about thought “it was quick enough” and “worth it to save work for other people or get payment quicker”\n\nWe’ve not entirely left the barcode scanner behind. Lots of traders on the scheme are processing vouchers in a home office rather than at their stalls, and we’re keen to see if we can offer them a “bulk” solution that might involve a supermarket scanner for speed. However, we’re spending some time to improve it rather than concentrating of the barcode scanner right now.\n\nAt the same time as working up the \"mark one text box\", we were prototyping an interface in paper for the whole process. Starting with our initial user research, we quickly sketched up a [very lo-fidelity paper prototype.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d6Y-TBmyuKelZheUtHeUV1Q2M/view?usp=sharing \"A prototype\")\n\nWe took that prototype out, set up in a community hub near the market in Barnsley and invited traders in to run through how it'd work. Here's the [insights from that usability test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d6Y-TBmyuKZW90Zlc2NEtRY2c/view?usp=sharing \"A pdf of a test report\"), and the conversations it sparked.\n\nFrom that, we iterated to a [paper prototype which also included a “download” option](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d6Y-TBmyuKZkpCNUVuVWVIakk/view?usp=sharing \"Another prototype video\") - sparked by talking to users about how they need to include things in their own accounts process. \n\nWe initially thought that we would be developing a system that supported the 4 different payment types that the 4 different areas currently involved in the project use. However as the user research brings us closer to the traders, and as we all look hard at our assumptions (in this case the need for the project to offer quite so much flexibility), it seems that we may actually be helping to streamline that so that all traders are paid directly as a result of using the new system.  Don’t hold us to that yet though - we reserve the right to change our mind.",

That led us to a first engagement with the UK's [Comic Relief](https://www.comicrelief.com/).

Our mantra then and now is: people, situations, ideas. Take your project objectives, examine the people you have in mind through the lens of the situations they find themselves in, and ideas will emerge. It's fractal too; those ideas can come at all levels from a new business or digital tool to a small enhancement to an existing digital service. We've more experience now, but that process is often still our first touchpoint with a big brand, and still enables us to make rapid progress to something we can build and test some more. Our experience is that the process is welcomed - the accent on people speaks to marketing teams' instinct for a focus there too, and the insights that operations people have gained in daily engagement with customers is invaluable input.\n\nWhere Comic Relief went next is also instructive.

[Mind Of My Own](http://mindofmyown.org.uk/) has always worked on a build, measure, learn cycle; starting with an assumption, and building out an experiment to test it. This approach is championed in the tech-for-good world by organisations like [CAST; the Centre for the Acceleration of Social Technology](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/).

Maybe it'll say that a quantitative approach might tell you where a design might have problems, but you need an artist to tell you how to solve that problem. I hope and believe it'll be flexible.

Local tech events for young people can be difficult to find, so doing it again was an easy call. \n\nDuring Untangled 2017, 8 young people from the Norwich area took part in a week long event to create a game. Untangled is all about young people making the decisions, they collectively agreed on the style. Ideas such as a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario and a 'Battle Royale' type game were discussed with a final vote to decide. The result? A top down capture the flag game.\n\nThe young people were mentored by Neontribe staff and local game developers, teaching and assisting with the creation of the game.\n\nUsing [Raspberry Pi’s](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-retro-gaming-bundle) and the [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) programming language they started their journey into software development… \n\n![](/content/images/2017/08/map_test-1.jpg)\n\nDay 1 of the event consisted of orientation and planning:\n\n- Teaching everyone the basis of maintaining version control using Git in their own [GitHub](https://www.github.co.uk) account.\n- Making sure everyone knew the core concepts of working on a team project and how to make concurrent changes to the code.\n- All of the development work was then planned out and each task was assigned to someone based on their interests, whether they were a programmer or a more visual designer.\n\nThe following days were spent developing the functionality: \n\n- George [(@GLBro)](https://github.com/GLBro) and Nat [(@whizzer0)](https://github.com/whizzer0) making the map of the game. \n- Raphie [(@Raph-child)](https://github.com/Raph-child) and Oli [(@DuctTapeNinja)](https://github.com/DuctTapeNinja) worked together to add spells and projectiles. \n- James [(@LiveG-Technologies)](https://github.com/LiveG-Technologies) maintained the documentation by creating a [wiki.](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/wiki)\n- Ruben [(@thegraphicsgamer)](https://github.com/thegraphicsgamer) was the textures man, editing each individual texture to fit the game.\n- James [(@OverHill123)](https://github.com/OverHill123) worked on power-ups for the game, letting the player perform actions such as increasing their speed to gain an advantage.\n- and some even tried to hack the game(!) - an unspecified design goal.\n\nDevelopment was successful enough that advanced functionality was eventually added to the engine; a minimap, displaying player locations, and a HUD which displayed information about the player, both by Harry [(@spannner)](https://github.com/spannner). \n\n![](/content/images/2017/08/everyone-1.jpg)\n\nNeontribe kept to the industry standard for fixing bugs, 1 bug fix equals 1 Kit-Kat! Favourite bugs reports?\n\n[Make everything not lava](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/issues/75)\n\nand the beautiful;\n\n[Bullets need to go faster because all clients can out run it](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/issues/84)\n\nThe final day of Untangled 2017 was spent playing the finished game, the highlight being the developers vs Neontribe in a 4v4 capture the flag match, fueled with childish screaming and frustration coming almost exclusively from the Neontribers. The event was concluded with a presentation given by the young people, explaining their experiences and what they had learnt over the week.\n\nNeontribe believes learning never stops, so everyone was given their Raspberry Pi’s to leave with, letting them continue to code at home and of course play their amazing game!\n\nThe code for the game can be found at [Untangled-2017.](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017)\n\n![](/content/images/2017/08/bridge-1.jpg)\n\n**Many thanks to Paul and Luke from [SoftApps](http://softapps.co.uk) for mentoring and helping with the event!**",

A top down capture the flag game.</p>\n\n<p>The young people were mentored by Neontribe staff and local game developers, teaching and assisting with the creation of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-retro-gaming-bundle\">Raspberry Pi’s</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.learnpython.org/\">Python</a> programming language they started their journey into software development… </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/08/map_test-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Day 1 of the event consisted of orientation and planning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Teaching everyone the basis of maintaining version control using Git in their own <a href=\"https://www.github.co.uk\">GitHub</a> account.</li>\n<li>Making sure everyone knew the core concepts of working on a team project and how to make concurrent changes to the code.</li>\n<li>All of the development work was then planned out and each task was assigned to someone based on their interests, whether they were a programmer or a more visual designer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following days were spent developing the functionality: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>George <a href=\"https://github.com/GLBro\">(@GLBro)</a> and Nat <a href=\"https://github.com/whizzer0\">(@whizzer0)</a> making the map of the game. </li>\n<li>Raphie <a href=\"https://github.com/Raph-child\">(@Raph-child)</a> and Oli <a href=\"https://github.com/DuctTapeNinja\">(@DuctTapeNinja)</a> worked together to add spells and projectiles. </li>\n<li>James <a href=\"https://github.com/LiveG-Technologies\">(@LiveG-Technologies)</a> maintained the documentation by creating a <a href=\"https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/wiki\">wiki.</a></li>\n<li>Ruben <a href=\"https://github.com/thegraphicsgamer\">(@thegraphicsgamer)</a> was the textures man, editing each individual texture to fit the game.</li>\n<li>James <a href=\"https://github.com/OverHill123\">(@OverHill123)</a> worked on power-ups for the game, letting the player perform actions such as increasing their speed to gain an advantage.</li>\n<li>and some even tried to hack the game(!) - an unspecified design goal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Development was successful enough that advanced functionality was eventually added to the engine; a minimap, displaying player locations, and a HUD which displayed information about the player, both by Harry <a href=\"https://github.com/spannner\">(@spannner)</a>. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/08/everyone-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Neontribe kept to the industry standard for fixing bugs, 1 bug fix equals 1 Kit-Kat! Favourite bugs reports?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/issues/75\">Make everything not lava</a></p>\n\n<p>and the beautiful;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017/issues/84\">Bullets need to go faster because all clients can out run it</a></p>\n\n<p>The final day of Untangled 2017 was spent playing the finished game, the highlight being the developers vs Neontribe in a 4v4 capture the flag match, fueled with childish screaming and frustration coming almost exclusively from the Neontribers. The event was concluded with a presentation given by the young people, explaining their experiences and what they had learnt over the week.</p>\n\n<p>Neontribe believes learning never stops, so everyone was given their Raspberry Pi’s to leave with, letting them continue to code at home and of course play their amazing game!</p>\n\n<p>The code for the game can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017\">Untangled-2017.</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/08/bridge-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Many thanks to Paul and Luke from <a href=\"http://softapps.co.uk\">SoftApps</a> for mentoring and helping with the event!</strong></p>",

In the week of the event I learnt more mentoring the enthusiastic youth of Norwich than during any week of my university life.\n\nThis year the mentors’ job was simple: create the base game for Untangled before the event, then manage and assist the young people with adding suggested features during the week.\n\nThe mentors consisted of Neontribers and local game developers wanting to give back to the local community.\n\nBy performing the trivial framework tasks such as implementing the network capabilities and creating the default map beforehand it allowed the week to be more productive, with no long delays in development and letting the young people begin making new features immediately. \n\nThe difference between the [base game](https://github.com/Stansbridge/untangled-2017) and the [result of Untangled 2017](https://github.com/neontribe/untangled-2017) is astounding.\n\n![](/content/images/2017/08/contributions.png)\n\nDuring the week the mentors were the young people’s guide, teaching them the basics of software development and then assisting them with any problems that arose. We would always guide them in a constructive direction, without solving the problem outright. This allowed the participants of the event to overcome obstacles themselves.\n\nMy advice for future mentors of Untangled is to mimic 2017’s model, and have a solid base for the young people to work from. Untangled is chaotic by nature, so having this head start is beneficial for everyone.\n\nThere weren’t many negatives with this year's Untangled, everyone made progress as a software developer and the final result was a fully functional game. Some minor things I would suggest in the future would be to have control over the Pis (or whatever machine). Being able to lock everyone's screen for example would make communicating as a group much easier, with fewer distractions.\n\nOne of the most important skills in industry is the ability to work as part of a team, and this is especially relevant in software development. The current education system doesn’t emphasise this enough, with most schools teaching students how to create systems by themselves and rarely giving them the opportunity to work in larger teams. This makes events like Untangled even more important.\n\n![](/content/images/2017/08/oli.jpg)\n\nMy final thoughts, as a mentor of Untangled 2017, are of satisfaction and relief. The week ran as smooth as any event such as this could, and with a successful result. Everyone learnt something, even the mentors, with teaching being the best way to learn.\n\nI encourage anyone interested in this industry to get involved with Untangled or a similar event.

Our brief was to study the journeys of those engaged in publishing open data to the IATI standard and to produce a three-slide summary. \n\nThe outcome was [nine slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q9zkM5jRhFd_nxPSqm99KsomIlRygmH0EombnsZlBnY/), with [annotated journeys to back them up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d6Y-TBmyuKbkZORXZxYW5UUTg/) and as a result Neontribe were engaged on a development project: produce a user interface that packaged some useful publishing tools together. \n\nThe top-line observation from that initial research in particular really stuck with us: carrots vs. sticks. Motivating publishers to produce quality data, rather than simply - in the face of time pressure and all the other constraints we all share - doing what compliance demanded. The ones we spoke to would be motivated to publish good quality data if they were confident it was being used. From our own involvement in countless hack days, and projects large and small, we knew that to be used, data has to be good quality. \n\nThat's the chicken and egg of open data right there. Good quality data is more likely to be used. Data is more likely to be good quality if its publishers believe it'll get used. What we want to do is break that vicious cycle. \n\nThis keys into the mission of our friends at [Open Data Services](http://www.opendataservices.coop/) who introduced us to IATI in the first place. As they put it, \"We aim to make open data Useful, Usable and In Use.\"\n\nOur first interface scribblings were in this direction: towards an interface which tells publishers how their data can be used right now, and how it *could* be used if they improved it. Our core concept is that this order of things is more motivating than its opposite; that it is better to say what is good, and then what could be better, than it is to say what has failed and needs fixing. \n\nAt that point, we were unsure of a technical approach that'd make it feasible to actually provide this interface. \n\nHowever, turns out that the idea that the fitness of a dataset to a particular purpose is programmatically testable is not new.\n\nIn fact, the folk at [Publish What You Find](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/) had done some work there for data that's compliant to the IATI standard back in March this year. They've blogged about their [Data Quality Tester here.](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/publish-what-you-fund-launches-new-index-data-quality-tool-and-technical-consultation/) It uses something like a test-driven development approach, with some Python code to check data quality by checking to see if the dataset itself passes an explicit test. \n\nAt the same time as we were working on our interface ideas, the ODS folk were building out the concept of \"Opinionated Review\". That's the idea that their [COVE tools](http://cove.opendataservices.coop/) could be extended from testing for validity to testing for a wider range of conditions and circumstances. \n\nWe'd already committed to working with COVE as part of our publishing toolkit, so this put us in an excellent place implementation-wise.\n \nWhere we are now is taking examples of ways people actually use data, which we can articulate programmatically so we can a) test people's data to see if it is usable in such a fashion and b) suggest appropriate data enhancement activities if it is not.

            "markdown": "My 1st task at Neontribe was to set up my Windows  development environment for Lavarel PHP-powered service that exposes a website and an API. \n\nMost developers here at Neontribe use Linux so as I was using Windows I expected a few issues to surface. Indeed, having chosen to use the Lavarel Homestead VM for simplicity, I found several sticking points not covered in the installation notes. Here's the steps you need to cover to get Homestead setup on Windows\n\n## PC configuration\n\n1. Ensure virtualisation is enabled in the BIOS \n2. Ensure hyper-v is not enabled in (`Turn Windows features on or off`) as you can only use a single Hypervisor and Homestead uses VirtualBox\n3. Ensure Bitdefender `Settings -> Advanced -> scan hosts file `option is off. Otherwise it'll comment out any lines you add.\n\n## Homestead configuration\n4. Follow [these instructions](http://backendtime.com/setup-laravel-homestead-windows/) to install Homestead and optionally Heidi. Note you can use the latest VirtualBox and Vagrant. Don't forget to edit the hosts file as administrator.\n5. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd` to install nfs support and add `type: nfs` to any folder mapping in `Homestead.yaml`. This can significantly boost performance.\n6. Adjust the Folders sections in the `Homestead.yaml` file to be of this form: \n```yaml\nfolders:\n    - map: ~/Projects/onesite-dev \n      to: /home/vagrant/code/onesite-dev \n      type: nfs \n \nsites: \n    - map: onesite.dev \n      to: /home/vagrant/code/onesite-dev/public \n``` \n7. Run `vagrant reload --provision`\n8. Optionally set `export VAGRANT_CWD=/c/Users/Fred/projects/homestead` in your `.bashrc` so that Vagrqant will work in any directory\n \nThen run `vagrant up` to launch Homestead, followed by`vagrant ssh` to run any additional setup or installation steps in the Homestead VM environment.\n\nAs the folder mappings ensure the project source code is shared between Windows and Homestead you can also run your favourite editor and `git` editor in Windows rather than the Homestead VM ssh, eg using Git 4 Windows' bash shell. Just remember to make sure your editor and git configuration do not add 'CR' chars to end of lines and push them.\n",

So when we were asked to help to run a [Code First: Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk) (CF:G) course, we jumped at the chance!\n\n![](/content/images/2018/04/PWLX8864.jpg)\n\nWe were approached by [Dr. Pam Mayhew](http://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/p-mayhew)  from the University of East Anglia (UEA) who asked if we would be interested in helping out, so Kara and I stepped forward from Neontribe as well as Chris and Alice, 3rd Year Computing Science students from the UEA. We decided that Chris and I would be course leads. Now that we had a brilliant team of instructors, we (with the help of Code First: Girls and the UEA) opened applications for the course and advertised it out to all female & non-binary students.\n\nWe were slightly anxious that we wouldn’t get enough applicants to make running the course worthwhile, but what came next was completely unexpected. We got an email through from the CF:G programmes manager that we’d had <strong>135</strong> applicants! This was incredible news as it shows the amount of interest in learning to code among women in Norfolk and the potential of reducing the [diversity gap](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/gender-gap-a-look-at-50-tech) in our industry. However, CF:G usually advise to have 15-30 participants per course so we really had to narrow it down to those who were most passionate about learning to code. After scouring through the applications and finding a larger room to allow us more students, we selected 40 of the most enthusiastic, passionate and committed applicants. Below are some of the reasons why some of the students wanted to take part in the course.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/04/cfg-quotes.svg)\n\nOur first session covered the basics of HTML and we had a wide variety of skill sets among the participants. We made sure to cover everything in depth so that everybody was at the same level moving through the course. This worked quite well as we could give extra support to those who may have needed it. Throughout the rest of the sessions, we were able to teach further aspects of web development including basic design and functionality skills with Javascript and CSS as well as equally important non-programming concepts like User Experience. Some of the toughest lessons for the beginners to learn were the additional libraries to boost their newly acquired skills, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).\n\nA fantastic thing that this course indirectly encouraged was the importance of teamwork. A few sessions in, CF:G contributed towards a social event for instructors and participants to grab a bite to eat and a drink after the session. This allowed us to all get to know each other better as most of the chosen girls had come from different schools across the university, so may not have come across each other before. Subsequently we encouraged them to form small groups to work together to make a site. This led to the groups meeting outside of the course to develop their websites together and even creating WhatsApp groups to stay in touch.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-10-at-15.42.05.png)\n\nAll in all, leading this course was a wonderful experience and the resulting websites the groups managed to create were spectacular. The winning team ‘A team has no name’ managed to create [this incredible site](https://eerstewart1.github.io/CFG-CourseComp/index.html), with the runners up creating both [an interactive fiction game](https://arurie.github.io/mySite/index.html) and [a site to promote girl gaming in Norwich](https://ghoulpower.github.io/project-recall/site/).\n\nI’m very glad we decided to team up with the UEA as they were able to supply us a great room to use for the sessions and Pam was incredibly helpful and supportive at all stages of the course. I’m also pleased that CF:G were able to provide us such an extensive course, as the course materials covered aspects of web development that are often overlooked when beginning to learn such as Version Control and User Experience. \n\nFinally, I am most grateful for the team of instructors Kara and Alice and my co-lead Chris. They really put their all in volunteering their time to teach the course and support the students in their journey. This has proven to have paid off, as from the feedback we have since received, <strong>95%</strong> of participants said they would continue to code in the future and the average rating of the course was 4.7/5 which is just incredible. Teaching the course and supporting the students was a lot of fun and I’m so glad that the students found the course really worthwhile too.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/04/2018-01-23-20.06.48-1.jpg)\n",

I was astounded to discover that I was in the presence of female developers from some really big companies such as The New York Times and The Guardian.\n\nThe event then began with [Claire Slattery](https://www.claireslattery.com) giving us a [‘Speechless’ workshop](http://speechlesslive.com/). That not only got us energised for the evening ahead, but also gave helpful tips to improve presentation and communication skills. Radha Narayan then came to the stage, introducing her journey into tech & leadership from humble beginnings being raised in Saudi Arabia. Radha had a strong message that “the real leader in the room is not the one who is always talking, but the one who is listening and making sure everyone is heard” She also mentioned that “people are not just complicated projects”, which resonated with me, as sometimes this personal aspect is far removed from leadership.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/05/4-6.png)\n\n[Sarah Drinkwater](https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater) then introduced us to her panel of inspiring women in tech: [Jessie Link](https://twitter.com/mad_typist) (Director of Engineering - Twitter), Susan Standiford (COO - Zeal Network) & [Arfah Farooq](https://twitter.com/Arf_22) (Co-Founder - Muslamic Makers). They used their experience in the industry to answer interesting questions about how to influence culture in tech. \n\nA big message to come from them was that a supportive set of leaders within a company makes the biggest difference in encouraging a more diverse workforce.  ‘Plans are worthless, but planning is invaluable’ was amongst the valuable takeaways from their Q&A. They recommended tools such as [Impraise](https://www.impraise.com/) and [Office Vibe](https://www.officevibe.com/) to create a constant loop of honest feedback between leaders and their team.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/05/7-8.png)\n\nWe then had a break and a chance to enjoy the delicious goodies the host had put on for us. As well as the food, we could also enjoy the WTM photobooth and even play rock-paper-scissors against a robotic hand! The event volunteers were also handing out Android Things Starter Kits to each attendee. I have since had a great time putting mine together and experimenting with it.\n\nFinally, we headed back into the room to hear [Ruth John](https://twitter.com/Rumyra) discuss the future of the web as a platform (on the internet’s birthday!). This included not only her audiovisual code pens, showcasing what can be achieved with JS & CSS in interpreting sound to create beautiful visual interfaces, but also the use of WebVR & WebGL to bring virtual reality to web browsers.\n\n![](/content/images/2018/05/9-11.png)\n\nAll in all it was a great experience and an honour to be in the same room with such inspirational women and it has given me a new energy to really make a positive impact on this industry and encourage other amazing women to do the same.\n",

This included not only her audiovisual code pens, showcasing what can be achieved with JS &amp; CSS in interpreting sound to create beautiful visual interfaces, but also the use of WebVR &amp; WebGL to bring virtual reality to web browsers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/9-11.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>All in all it was a great experience and an honour to be in the same room with such inspirational women and it has given me a new energy to really make a positive impact on this industry and encourage other amazing women to do the same.</p>",

You can get involved by exploring the <a href=\"http://www.contemplatingaction.org.uk/\">Contemplating Action App</a> which we have created to show how we can reuse the work from the original project to help different groups of people. You can take a short survey to help us test the concept. If you find you think it is helpful, you could become one of a small number of services partnering with us for the the next phase.

We've got a national reputation for our work in tech-for-good, an international reputation in travel and tourism, and right now we have more and more work coming our way.\n\nWe're expanding our teams in Norwich & Exeter. Right now, we’re recruiting to fill a couple of specific roles. However, we’re also always on the look out for people who would make our teams stronger, so if those roles don’t suit you please see the information at the end.  \n\nThe two specific roles that will start out on a long-running project for an International corporate client are:\n\n##Working mainly in HTML/CSS\n\nYou'll have a flair for implementing user interfaces using web technologies. Your tools will be HTML, CSS, and some Javascript and you’ll be passionate about HTML/CSS as a medium. You’ll already have plenty of experience of delivering in complex team projects and a commitment to delivering accessibility. You'll fully understand that what you are designing are interactions, on screens that vary in size, not fixed images on a fixed canvas. You'll have opinions on how to manage CSS in a team and you'll enjoy discussing different approaches to building and maintaining design systems.\n\n##Working in JAVASCRIPT\n\nYou’ll be experienced at delivering javascript and confident in working with a complex project team. You’ll need to be comfortable working on the server, or in the toolchain, as well as in the client. We’d expect you to either have strong existing skills in Node.js, GraphQL, npm packaging or React or experience under your belt that shows how you transfer understanding between tools and frameworks so you can pick those up quickly from a wider javascript base.\n\n##Alongside your core technical skills if you join us you’ll also need to:\n\n* Be comfortable communicating in a remote team;\n* Enjoy taking part in conversations in technical subjects;\n* Be able to demonstrate that you enjoy expanding your knowledge and thinking critically \n(this can be via a degree, but 1/3rd of our team members don’t have one, so doesn’t have to be);\n* Value agility in software development (experience is an advantage but not essential)\n* Be passionate about accessibility\n* Be keen to work in an organisation that delivers both commercial and social good projects\n* Be inspired by user-centred development (even if you don’t have practical experience of this approach)\n* Be committed to taking part in team activities and individual learning\n\n##What these roles are not:\n\nNeither of these are beginner roles. \nYou’ll need to have worked in coding teams on established projects and have well-developed skills in the appropriate languages for each role. You’ll also need to be able to show how your work experience to date equips you both for communicating with a remote team and getting your head down to get on with the task. \n\n##What these roles are:\n\nGreat opportunities for growth and enjoyment. \nNeontribe prides itself on skills development, great training budgets, flexible working, part-time hours and supporting return to work and other initiatives to help you enjoy your work. \nAvailable at different career stages\nWe want to appoint one person who in addition to meeting the technical descriptions of their role, has experience of team leading and a passion for mentoring others and is ready to take on those responsibilities and another who is focused on delivering their own work but doesn’t yet want wider responsibility.  \nAvailable in either Norwich or Exeter\nWe can also discuss possible mixed office and work from home patterns\n\n##Salary\n\nThe salary available for the role involving mentoring will be in the region of £32-37k whereas the salary for the role focused predominantly on using your own skills will be in the region of £26-31k.  Depending on applicants, either role could have either HTML/CSS or Javascript skill set\n\n##To Apply\n\nSend us your CV, or a list of skills and relevant experience, and a short email to indicate which role, and which level you think you would be interested, and we’ll arrange to set up a chat. We will interview anyone with the right skill set when we hear from them, so advise getting applications in as soon as possible. <future@neontribe.co.uk>\n\n##Want to work with us, but don’t fit this role?\n\nWe’re always happy to hear from people who like the sound of Neontribe, and want to grow their skills as a developer, or in user research or product management. Maybe you’re already experienced - but have different specialist languages or maybe you're just getting started.

Apart from being a distasteful power grab by Google, email is fragile enough without mail history going missing or being subject to a gatekeeper.\n\n## How\n\n### Disabling Confidential Mode outbound mail\nLog into the [Admin Console](https://gsuite.google.com/) for your domain.\n\n* Choose `Apps -> G Suite -> Gmail -> User Settings`\n* Under `Confidential Mode` select `Disabled` and save.\n\n![Confidential Mode -> Disable](/content/images/2019/05/user-confidential-mode.png)\n\n### Rejecting Confidential Mode inbound mail\nFrom the [Admin Console](https://gsuite.google.com/) for your domain:\n\n* Choose `Apps -> G Suite -> Gmail -> Advanced Settings -> Content compliance`\n* Add policy:\n\t* `Name: Confidential Mode Rejection`\n\t* `Email messages to affect: Inbound`\n\t* `Add expressions that describe the content you want to search for in each message: If ANY of the following match the message` and add the following expression:\n\t\t* `Type: Metadata match`\n\t\t* `Attribute: Gmail confidential mode`\n\t\t* `Match type: Message is in Gmail confidential mode`\n\t\t* Save the expression\n\t* `If the above expressions match, do the following: Reject message`\n\t\t* `Customize rejection notice: This domain does not accept messages sent with Gmail Confidential Mode enabled.

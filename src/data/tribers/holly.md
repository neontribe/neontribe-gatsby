My background is in Design for Publishing but during my final year at university I discovered user-centered design. I found it interesting how putting the user at the forefront of all design choices changed the way I worked. I enjoy working on social good projects as I love to use design to make a positive impact. When I am not working Iâ€™m playing board games or video games, watching American Football (Go Hawks!) and looking at Hedgehog gifs.

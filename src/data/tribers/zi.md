Start joining Neontribe in 2019. Currently, I'm a computer science degree student who's doing my placement year. Enjoying coding with everyone and exploring Exeter at the same time. Having a head start in experiencing my working life after graduate and it's suprisingly more fun than what I am expecting. Am enthusiastic to come to work everyday, to see and pet the poodle which it's owner is working behind me, learn new things as well.

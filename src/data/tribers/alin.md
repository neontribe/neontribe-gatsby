After a dozen years working with the United Nations I shifted my career to programming. I have experimented with JavaScript and PHP since 2017 and I strive to be a better developer every day. I joined Neontribe in 2019 hoping to use my skills in tech-for-good. When I don't dream about code (seriously now, when do the JavaScript dreams end???), I think about food, cycling along rivers that cross more than one country and 'untranslatable' words from any language (such as Sisu - Finnish for extraordinary determination/courage, especially in the face of adversity - and Utepils - Norwegian for a beer that is enjoyed outside particularly on the first warm and sunny day of the year). Addicted to stories and storytelling, Coen brothers movies and playing football. I do not have a pet alpaca.

  Reducing the stress of disability benefit assessments
client: |
  seAp
problem: |
  People in need of assistance because of long term health problems or disabilities often find the process of applying for PIP and ESA benefits confusing, overwhelming and frustrating. We wanted to remove some of that pain.
solution: |
  Good practice questions, presented simply, that you can dip in and out of when you feel able helps some of the people seAp work with feel more prepared for assessments. That means seAp staff have more time to offer other support.
